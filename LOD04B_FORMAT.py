### Description of script
#All publicly available data (Open Government Data â€“ OGD) of the Statistical Office of the Canton of Zurich
#are extracted from the central JSON-file. By downloading and opening up every file, additional data can be
#extracted such as variable names that are not described in the metadata. Extracted is thus a combination
#between metadata and some information in the dataset.

# thoughts for improvement
# - much more metadata could be extracted
# - This could later be improved to save the data in a mysql-db.
