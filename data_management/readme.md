# STATBOT - DATA MANAGEMENT FOLDER

This runs all the R and python scripts necessary to generate the necessary data for statbot. It is supposed to be built as some form of cronjob to be executed once a day. All the statistical offices can contribtue here with scripts. Or they can contribute then in another step by adding additional data-files.
