# Setup Google Collab

Here we are going to describe how to set up a work environment for you. 

### a) Work with Google Colab

Google Colab allows you to work online on the repository. This way there is no need for having jupyter notebook or any of the dependencies. 
Just open the following file, follow the instructions and start coding:

### b) Work locally

Of course you can also work locally on your computer. To do so: 
- Clone te repository from https://github.com/statistikZH/statbot
- in your command line / terminal, create a virtual environment xxxx
- execute requirements.txt
- connect each notebook to the virtual environment: xxxx

Happy coding!
